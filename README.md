Originally inted as a todo app to practice Authentication, NextJS, Prisma, and Vercel. This app is still in progress. It is an application meant to implement the VOMIT journaling method as described in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8RQsJ0Q3Mo) video.

The live app can be accessed [here](postgres-prisma-todo-1z0nllqe8-zbaker94s-projects.vercel.app)
